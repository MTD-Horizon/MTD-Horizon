- 👋 Hi, I’m @MTD-Horizon
- 👀 I’m interested in C#, Java, and C++, and networking
- 🌱 I’m currently learning on my own, but I've made a primative 3D engine, and a multiplayer game with client prediction, lag compensation, and roll-back
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on small C# projects (Unity is preffered)
- 📫 How to reach me: charliescan105@gmail.com
